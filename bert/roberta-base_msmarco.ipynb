A rotator cuff tear is a tear of one or more of the tendons of the four rotator cuff muscles. A rotator cuff injury can include any type of irritation or damage to the rotator cuff muscles or tendons.PubMed Health Glossary.he tendons of your rotator cuff can tear for a variety of reasons: 1  An injury, such as falling or being hit in the shoulder. 2  Overuse over time from repeated actions, such as lifting, painting, cleaning windows, or throwing. 3  Natural wear and tear from aging. The rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and tendons that closely surround the shoulder joint. Rotator cuff tears are very common. Most rotator cuff tears are caused by gradual wear of the tendon material as we age.he rotator cuff is a group of four muscles and tendons that closely surround the shoulder joint. Rotator cuff tears are very common. Most rotator cuff tears are caused by gradual wear of the tendon material as we age. 1 Repetitive stress. 2  Repeating the same shoulder motions again and again can stress your rotator cuff muscles and tendons. 3  Baseball, tennis, rowing, and weightlifting are examples of sports activities that can put you at risk for overuse tears. 4  Many jobs and routine chores can cause overuse tears, as well.here is a lubricating sac called a bursa between the rotator cuff and the bone on top of your shoulder (acromion). The bursa allows the rotator cuff tendons to glide freely when you move your arm. When the rotator cuff tendons are injured or damaged, this bursa can also become inflamed and painful. The most common symptoms of a rotator cuff tear include: 1  Pain at rest and at night, particularly if lying on the affected shoulder. 2  Pain when lifting and lowering your arm or with specific movements. 3  Weakness when lifting or rotating your arm. 4  Crepitus or crackling sensation when moving your shoulder in certain positions.here is a lubricating sac called a bursa between the rotator cuff and the bone on top of your shoulder (acromion). The bursa allows the rotator cuff tendons to glide freely when you move your arm. When the rotator cuff tendons are injured or damaged, this bursa can also become inflamed and painful. Re-occurring degeneration and disorganization of the tendons of the rotator cuff can lead to small tears that do not properly heal. This results in a weakened tendon that is more susceptible to serious injuries. The shoulder is a complex joint in the body that is made up of a number of bones, tendons, and muscles.lthough overuse is the most common cause of rotator cuff injuries, other factors are associated with an increased risk of injury, including being male, being older, and having a history of shoulder injury or trauma. The shoulder is subject to other injuries besides rotator cuff tears, including tendinitis and bursitis.\",\n",

The most common names for sugar are: barley malt, corn syrup, dextrose, fruit juice concentrate, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, maltodextrin, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose and turbinado sugar.Here’s a more complete sugar list with 69 sugar names.his list of sugar facts and sugar names will help you uncover the many hidden sugars that are tucked away everywhere in our food today. Biopolymers of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose (C 6H 12O 6) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose (C 12H 22O 11).n general, galactose does not occur in the free state but is a constituent with glucose of the disaccharide lactose or milk sugar. It is less sweet than glucose. It is a component of the antigens found on the surface of red blood cells that determine blood groups. A molecule of sucrose. Glucose and fructose are monosaccharide sugars. A monosaccharide is the smallest unit of sugar, mono meaning 1. Sucrose is commonly called table sugar and is a disaccharide. A disaccharide is a sugar that is made up of two sugar units, di meaning 2.Sucrose is produced as glucose and fructose are joined together by a condensation reaction.In the process a water molecule is eliminated. See the following equation.hese sugar molecules include glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, maltose, lactose and galactose. Sugar molecules are classified as monosaccharides or disaccharides. The following table lists the common sugar molecules are their chemical formula. Name. (2) Any sweet, crystalline solid disaccharide used as sweetener or preservative. Supplement. The term sugar is the generic term for any disachharides (e.g. sucrose) and monosaccharides (e.g. fructose, glucose). Sugars are essential structural component of living cells and source of energy in many organisms.2) Any sweet, crystalline solid disaccharide used as sweetener or preservative. Supplement. The term sugar is the generic term for any disachharides (e.g. sucrose) and monosaccharides (e.g. fructose, glucose). Sugars are essential structural component of living cells and source of energy in many organisms. The white stuff we know as sugar is sucrose, a molecule composed of 12 atoms of carbon, 22 atoms of hydrogen, and 11 atoms of oxygen (C12H22O11). Like all compounds made from these three elements, sugar is a carbohydrate.Its found naturally in most plants, but especially in sugarcane and sugar beetshence their names.ucrose is actually two simpler sugars stuck together: fructose and glucose. In recipes, a little bit of acid (for example, some lemon juice or cream of tartar) will cause sucrose to break down into these two components.\n",

      "Hoda, you are a partner and a friend and a sister, and I am so happy to be doing this. It marks the first time NBC's popular morning show has two female co-anchors. While NBC did not make public just how much Kotb would be earning with this new position — she is still co-hosting Today's fourth hour with Kathie Lee Gifford — many will likely be wondering if she'll be making as much money as Lauer had in that spot. NBC's Today show viewers got a delightful surprise on Tuesday morning, when Savannah Guthrie announced on the show that Hoda Kotb would be the show's new permanent co-host. NBC did not say whether its longtime journalist, whose net worth reportedly stood at $12 million towards the end of 2016, would be getting a raise, but Kotb's salary as a Today anchor might see a substantial increase. Kotb, in comparison, has an estimated net worth of $12 million, according to a 2016 report. Her net worth is only a portion of Lauer's yearly salary. Though she has worked for NBC since 1998, she's yet to become the sort of star whose salary negotiations receive press attention. Kotb was a respected anchor, but she never lorded over Today the way Lauer did. Which might be why her salary in 2018 won't hold a candle to Lauer's pile of cash. Advertisement At the time, Lauer's estimated salary from NBC was between $20-$25 million, making him the highest-paid anchor at the network. His firing from NBC put Megyn Kelly at the top, but it's unclear whether Kotb — or Guthrie, for that matter — will get a pay raise, especially since the Today show's ratings have soared in the wake of Lauer's ousting. An American nationality, Hoda was born in the year 1964 on 9th of August, which makes her 52 years old at this time. She was born in Norman, which lies in Oklahoma in the United States of America to her parents A.K Kotb and Samaha Kotb. Hoda Kotb’s salary for hosting the ‘Today’ show is reportedly much less than what Matt Lauer was making for the same gig. Here’s why she isn’t upset by the huge difference. Hoda Kotb, 53, has officially replaced Matt Lauer, 60, on the Today show — but for a salary that doesn’t even come close to her predecessor‘s. The new host will reportedly make a modest $7 million, according to Page Six. But at the same time, Hoda will also continue to host the 10 a.m. hour of the show with Kathie Lee Gifford, 64, so hopefully she’ll get closer to Matt’s salary considering she’s doing twice the work. Hoda Kotb Husband, Divorce, Boyfriend, Salary and Net Worth. Date: 23 Nov, 2014 Report This. The beautiful and talented Hoda Kotb is one of the most beloved news anchors, and Television shows host in the industry. She has dazzled everyone with her communication skills and demonstrated her marvelous work. Even if the gap between Kotb and Lauer's salary is ignored, what's harder to explain is the fact that $5 million is paltry in comparison to Megyn Kelly's reported $15 million salary. Even Ann Curry, at the time of her departure, made $12 million as Lauer's co-anchor. Kotb may be new to the 7:00 a.m. slot, but she is not new to NBC.\n",

When you write a narrative essay, you are telling a story. Narrative essays are told from a defined point of view, often the author's, so there is feeling as well as specific and often sensory details provided to get the reader involved in the elements and sequence of the story. One last component of narrative writing is point of view. Point of view is the perspective in which the story is told. The two main points of view are first-person and third-person. Setting. The setting is another component of narrative writing. The setting is the time and the location in which the story takes place. These facts set the scene for the story and can determine what kind of conflict occurs. In this lesson you will learn what makes a piece of writing a narrative.

The bursa allows the rotator cuff tendons to glide freely when you move your arm. When the rotator cuff tendons are injured or damaged, this bursa can also become inflamed and painful. The most common symptoms of a rotator cuff tear include: 1  Pain at rest and at night, particularly if lying on the affected shoulder. 2  Pain when lifting and lowering your arm or with specific movements. 3  Weakness when lifting or rotating your arm. 4  Crepitus or crackling sensation when moving your shoulder in certain positions.here is a lubricating sac called a bursa between the rotator cuff and the bone on top of your shoulder (acromion). The bursa allows the rotator cuff tendons to glide freely when you move your arm. When the rotator cuff tendons are injured or damaged, this bursa can also become inflamed and painful. Re-occurring degeneration and disorganization of the tendons of the rotator cuff can lead to small tears that do not properly heal. This results in a weakened tendon that is more susceptible to serious injuries. The shoulder is a complex joint in the body that is made up of a number of bones, tendons, and muscles.lthough overuse is the most common cause of rotator cuff injuries, other factors are associated with an increased risk of injury, including being male, being older, and having a history of shoulder injury or trauma. The shoulder is subject to other injuries besides rotator cuff tears, including tendinitis and bursitis.\",\n",

This basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres (2,700,000 sq mi), of which 5,500,000 square kilometres (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. States or departments in four nations contain \"Amazonas\" in their names. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.\""
